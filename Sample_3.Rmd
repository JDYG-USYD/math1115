# Instructions

:::{.alert .alert-danger}
This is a selection of questions taken from a past exam paper. Answers are not provided by default but can be demonstrated by a tutor.
:::

## Getting started

1. You have been provided a data file, `PlaneCrashes.csv` and *this* R Markdown file to complete the exam.
2. Read the data briefing. It will provide useful information about the variables in the dataset.

5. All plots **must** be in `ggplot2`. Note that diagnostic plots (Residual, QQ plots) that are used to test for data assumptions may remain as base R plots.
6. **Do not edit this template.** Only provide answers in the appropriate blocks (see below).
7. For all hypothesis testing questions, unless stated otherwise, assume that $\alpha = 0.05$.

## Writing your answers

- All answers should be written within the answer alert blocks provided. These alert boxes look like below in the source document:

```
::: {.alert .alert-info}

Write your answers within this block, including code chunks.

```


## Submission

1. When the time is up (100 min), you will have 15 minutes to submit your assignment.

# Briefing on Data
The data provided contains information on historical plane crashes from 1980 to 2018. There are 5782 observations and 13 variables:

1. `date`: Date of accident (January 01, 2001 format)
2. `time`: Local time (24 hour format)
3. `location`: location information
4. `operator`: Airline or aircraft operator.
5. `flight_no`: Flight number 
6. `route`: Complete or partial route flown prior to accident.
7. `ac_type`: Aircraft type
8. `registration`: ICAO registration
9. `cn_ln`: Construction number/Line number
10. `aboard`: Total aboard (passengers/crew)
11. `air`: Total killed in air (passengers/crew)
12. `ground`: Total killed on the ground
13. `total`: Total killed in crash

There are many missing observations denoted with a `?`.   

## PART A: SETTING UP {-}
Before beginning any data analysis/wrangling, it is advisable to first set up the .rmd document by loading any required packages and data. This keeps the document neat and readable. 

i) Install and load the `tidyverse` package
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
ii) Save the `PlaneCrashes.csv` dataset available from the Canvas Exam page and replace the code below so that the file is loaded from your local folder, and not the web link.
```{r}
plane <- read.csv("data/PlaneCrashes.csv")
plane_CLEAN <- read_csv("data/PlaneCrashesCLEAN.csv")
```

## PART B: CLEANING DATA{-}
The dataset has many variables that are not in a helpful format. Therefore, the dataset needs to be cleaned and wrangled into something that would be useful for further analysis. 

i) Change the single `date` variable into three variables: `month`, `day`, `year`.

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
library(lubridate)
plane %>% 
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date)) %>% 
  mutate(day = day(date)) -> plane
```

Now we have our 3 new variables.

:::


ii) Keep only the total number `aboard` and total number of `air` deaths (i.e. the first values of the columns) and drop the rest (i.e. the passenger/crew distinction)

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
plane_CLEAN %>% 
  select(aboard, air) -> only_2
aboard <- c(max(only_2$aboard, na.rm = T))
air <- c(max(only_2$air, na.rm = T))
data.frame(
  aboard, air
)
```


:::

iii) Drop these columns `flight_no`, `registration`, `cn_ln`

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
plane %>% 
  select(-flight_no, -registration, -cn_ln) -> plane
```


:::


## PART C: INITIAL DATA ANALYSIS {-}

Provide the following summaries/graphs and comment on the output.

i) A numerical summary for the `total` variable, including the standard deviation

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
summary(plane_CLEAN$total)
sd(plane_CLEAN$total, na.rm = TRUE)
```

:::

ii) A graph for the `total` variable

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
ggplot(plane_CLEAN, aes(plane_CLEAN$total)) +
  geom_bar()
```

:::

iii) A graph for the total number of deaths in the 20th Century versus the 21st Century (i.e use `total` and `year`)

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
plane_CLEAN %>% 
  select(total, year) %>% 
  mutate(is_21_century = case_when(
    year < 2000 ~ 0,
    year >= 2000 ~ 1
  )) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(factor(is_21_century), total)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 0.8) +
  xlab("Is 21 century?") +
  ylab("Total death")
```


:::


## PART D: BINOMIAL{-}

i) Create a table that looks like the one below where `all` is whether all passengers died (or not) and `n` is the number of crashes that fall in that category.

|all|n|
|---|-|
|NO|2069|
|YES|3674|


::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
data.frame(all = c('no', 'yes'),
           n = c(2069, 3674))
```


:::


ii) Calculate the chance of selecting a crash where all aboard died


::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
3674 / (2069 + 3674)
```

:::

iii) Model this sampling by a box model with 50 draws (with replacement) and calculate the expected value and standard error for the total number of crashes where all aboard died (i.e. `YES`) in the sample

::: {.alert .alert-info}

```{r}
box <- c(rep(0, times = 10000000 - 6397353), rep(1, times = 6397353))

ev <- mean(box) * 50

library(multicon)

se <- popsd(box) * sqrt(50)

c(ev,se)
```

From the model, we expect that out of 50 draws, nearly 32 of them should include a entire home/apt as an option, with expected error range of 3.4 draws.

:::


## PART E: CHI-SQUARE{-}
We are interested in whether there is a difference in crash occurrence where everyone aboard died between the months of the year. Perform a chi-squared test for independence to test this hypothesis. Report following the H A P T C process.   

i) First create a contingency table like the following:

|Month|NO|YES|
|-----|--|---|
|January|187|348|
|February|153|276|
|March|157|328|
|April|144|269|
|May|151|249|
|June|159|258|
|July|179|293|
|August|186|333|
|September|190|316|
|October|163|332|
|November|181|322|
|December|219|350|



::: {.alert .alert-info}

The `aboard` in `plane` is damaged by its weird encoding and `plane_CLEAN` does not have a date for month whatsoever.

:::

ii) Now perform the chi-squared test


::: {.alert .alert-info}

Same as above.

:::



## PART F: SIMPLE LINEAR REGRESSION {-}
Now we're interested in seeing if there is a linear relationship between crash occurence and Year from 1960 onwards. 

i) Subset the data to get the number of crashes per year from 1960 onwards.


::: {.alert .alert-info}

:::


ii) Calculate the linear correlation coefficient.


::: {.alert .alert-info}

iii) Check that Simple Linear Regression (SLR) assumptions are met by plotting the standardised residuals vs fitted values plot and a qqnorm plot. Comment on the plot and suggest alternatives if assumption(s) are not met.


::: {.alert .alert-info}

!Data Integrity Issue

:::



iv) Assuming that all assumptions are met, report the results of the SLR following the H A P T C process


::: {.alert .alert-info}

!Data Integrity Issue

v) Now plot the data as a scatterplot with the linear regression line


::: {.alert .alert-info}

## PART G: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY {-}
Include an executive summary covering the main points of this dataset/report.
